Battle Blaster is a small-scale game project developed as a technical showcase focused on gameplay systems, architecture, and Unreal Engine implementation.

The project explores a clean and modular game structure using Unreal Engine 5 (C++), emphasizing reusable components, clear responsibility separation, and data-driven logic.

## 🧠 Core Focus
- Gameplay system architecture
- C++ and Blueprint integration
- State management across levels
- Scalable and maintainable code design

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights
- Custom GameMode & GameInstance for match flow and level progression
- BasePawn architecture shared between Tanks and Towers
- HealthComponent system handling damage, death, and game state reactions
- Clear communication between actors and game systems (no spaghetti Blueprints)

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Unreal Engine 5
- C++ (gameplay systems, core logic)
- Blueprints (implementation and iteration support)

## 🎯 Project Goal
Battle Blaster is not intended to be a full commercial game, but a portfolio project demonstrating:

- Solid Unreal Engine architecture
- Gameplay systems thinking
- Technical problem-solving in real engine constraints
